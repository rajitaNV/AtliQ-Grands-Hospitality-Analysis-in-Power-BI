# Challenge 1 : Provide Insight to the Revenue Team in Hospitality Domain

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Things I learned from this Project:
-Exploring key Performance Indicators in the Hospitality domain. Some of them are as follows:
1.	Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): It is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure hotel performance. The measurement is calculated by multiplying a hotel's average daily room rate (ADR) by the occupancy rate.
2.	Average Daily Rate (ADR): The average daily rate (ADR) is widely used in the hospitality industry to indicate the average revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day. The average daily rate is one of the industry's key performance indicators (KPI).
3.	Occupancy Rate: It is the percentage of occupied rooms in your hotel at a given time.
4.	Revenue Realisation: it is the percentage of the revenue that is actually recognized compared to what was expected.
-Creating calculated columns
-Creating measures using the DAX language
-Using KPI indicators to show trends
